# varnish 1.0.2.9000 (2023-03-21)

## NEW FEATURES

* The lesson page footer now supports either a CITATION or CITATION.cff file
  (reported: @tobyhodges, implemented: @tobyhodges, #122;
  @froggleston, https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/pull/572)

# varnish 1.0.1 (2023-12-14)

## BUG FIX

* Font sizes for headings of overview box, callouts, and accordions now use
  relative units instead of pixels. This will cause a slight change in the
  appearance of these headings, but they will be more consistent as the size of
  the window changes.

# varnish 1.0.0 (2023-12-13)

## MAJOR VERSION NOTE

We are bumping the major version number with this release because this version
of {varnish} now requires a new set of `translate` variables to be passed (which
are provided by sandpaper >= 0.16.0). If these variables do not exist, the
template will contain no navigation text. 

This breaking change is a concious decision. The alternative for this was to
conditinally include translations and fall back to their hard-coded English text
when they did not exist. This may seem like a more reasonable choice, but it can
lead to upstream bugs that are difficult to detect (if translations are not
working, it's not clear what is the cause if the text is in English: is it
coming from {varnish} or is it coming from {sandpaper}?) and it makes
maintenance of these navigational elements more difficult because we would have
to update them in two places. 

## NEW FEATURES

* Translation of lesson elements is now incorporated. Translation strings within
  the HTML templates can be found be searching for the word `translate`. All
  variables are assumed to exist and are defined in The Workbench as PascalCase
  variables. In order for this version of {varnish} to work, it _requires_
  {sandpaper} version 0.16.0 or greater. **This is a breaking change**
  (reported: @zkamvar, #104; implemented: @zkamvar and @joelnitta, #105)
* Buttons to show/hide the sidebar and solutions now have extra data attributes
  that are used for the language used by the button when they are toggled. This
  is an improvement over hard-coding the phrases inside of the JavaScript.

## BUG FIX

* Overview box heading font sizes now scaled based on viewport size. This fixes
  issues where the heading would wrap in an ugly fashion.
  (reported: @jd-foster, #83, 
  @drmownickles, https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/57,
  @rbavery, https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/64, 
  @robadob, #111; fixed:
  @froggleston, #109, 
  @robadob, #112).
* Spacing and alignment of text improved in Software Carpentry logo.
  (reported: @tobyhodges, #107; fixed @tobyhodges, #110).
* Lesson title collision with search box resolved.
  (reported: @ocasia, #84; fixed @robadob, #113).

* Workbench Beta Phase `Edit on GitHub` links no longer redirect people to the
  beta phase intermediate page during the second stage of the beta phase.

# varnish 0.2.13

  redirect to a site that explains the purpose of the phase.

# varnish 0.2.6

* For lessons that use `workbench-beta: true`, the feedback URL has changed from
  <https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions/> to 
  <https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/KRBl4IZM>, so that we can get more
  specific feedback.

# varnish 0.2.5

* Workbench Beta messaging has been modified to be more visible and to link back
  to the original lesson if possible.
- The icon for lessons in "alpha" has been updated so it has a yellow background
  with a grey glyph so that the icon shows up better.

# varnish 0.2.4

* Callout block titles have been improved: The underline height for titles have
  been fixed to not look wonky when titles have multiple lines (reported:
  @anenadic, #53; fixed @zkamvar, #55). Moreover, the text transformation will
  no longer affect `code` and `kbd` elements. 
* Heading element sizes have been recoded to use relative units. There was not 
  enough specification in the original CSS to properly distinguish between H3
  and H4 elements; moreover, on tablet and mobile devices, the H1 heading looked
  smallter than the H2 heading due to a copy/paste error. This has been fixed by
  using relative calcualtions (@zkamvar, #55)
* Sidebar navigation now says "Episodes" instead of "Expand" when collapsed so 
  that it is less confusing for folks. (suggested by @drmowinckels,
  https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/16 (#47); fixed by @zkamvar, 
  #56)
* The collapsed sidebar label no longer reverts to saying "collapse" on a new
  page. 
* The hamburger menu for mobile devices now has a border so it's more clear
  that it is a menu (suggested by @drmowinckels,
  https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/16 (#47); fixed by @zkamvar, 
  #57)


# varnish 0.2.3

* Add support for displaying anchor links (requested @fiveop, 
  https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/285 and @anenadic, 
  https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/28; added: #54 by @zkamvar)

# varnish 0.2.2

* Formatting of list elements in the solutions and instructor notes now follows
  the same formatting as the rest of the content (reported: #51 by @tobyhodges, 
  fixed: #52 by @zkamvar)

# varnish 0.2.1

* The sidebar navigation in mobile and tablet views now includes all the 
  information that was included in the navigation bar for the desktop mode.

# varnish 0.2.0

* The sidebar state (expanded or collapsed) will now persist during navigation
  to another page in the same window/tab. Opening the site in a new window/tab
  will reset the sidebar state to expanded. (reported: #43 by @anenadic, fixed
  #46, @zkamvar). This fix uses the `sessionStorage` API. 

# varnish 0.1.16

* CHAPTERS has been temporarily renamed to EPISODES to reduce cognative load
  between the webpage and the source folders

# varnish 0.1.15

* The search field has been disabled to avoid confusion. We have not yet enabled
  search as this requires further testing. Disabling the search field means that
  it is now more clear that search is not yet available.
  (#44 by @zkamvar)

# varnish 0.1.14

* indicators for lesson development stage (pre-alpha, alpha, beta) have been 
  added as `<abbr>` elements with a link to the appropriate section in the CDH
  and `title` elements that describe the purpose of the stage. Visually hidden
  text follows the `<abbr>` element for users who can not perceive the lesson
  visually (#39 by @zkamvar, reviewed by @tobyhodges).
* FIX: .lesson-title and .lesson-title-md are now inline-block elements

# varnish 0.1.13

* An alert for the workbench beta phase is implemented if the lesson has
  `workbench-beta: true` in the `config.yaml`.

# varnish 0.1.12

* dropdown navigation no longer is hidden by the sidebar on XXL screens;
  z-index of `nav.bottom-nav` set to 3.
  (reported: #35 by @brownsarahm, fixed: #36 by @zkamvar)

# varnish 0.1.11
 
* blockquotes are now more clearly delineated from the rest of the content
  (reported: #27 by @fiveop, fixed: #31 by @zkamvar)

# varnish 0.1.10

* lab and incubator logos are now available.

# varnish 0.1.9

* custom workbench engines are now properly linked in the footer via the 
  `sandpaper_cfg` `pegboard_cfg`, and `varnish_cfg` variables.
