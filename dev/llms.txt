# {varnish}: Template for The Carpentries Workbench

[![varnish status
badge](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/badges/varnish)](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev)

This project is part of [The Carpentries
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). It serves as a
template for Carpentries lessons adapted from
[{pkgdown}](https://r-lib.github.io/pkgdown). There is no need to call
this package directly, it is installed via the
[{sandpaper}](https://github.com/zkamvar/sandpaper) package.

The html templates use [mustache templating
language](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) while the CSS and
JavaScript are compiled and minified on GitHub Actions.

## Installation

To install this package, you can use our [R-universe
repository](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev), which is updated
hourly.

``` r
install.packages("varnish", repos = "https://carpentries.r-universe.dev")
```

There is no need to call this package directly,
[{sandpaper}](https://github.com/zkamvar/sandpaper) will detect it and
copy the styling and templates to your lesson website.

## CSS and JavaScript

The CSS and JavaScript used for the lessons are minified using SASS and
uglifyjs. Their sources live in the
[`source/`](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/source/) folder
with directives to include their dependencies (bootstrap, jquery,
feather).

The minified versions are built via GitHub actions any time one of the
source files is changed.

To build this locally, you need to make sure to have a working version
of `node` and `npm`, which can be installed [via the node version
manager, nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro).

### Install dependencies

Once you have `nvm` installed, you can install the node packages locally
(they will install in the *`node_modules/`* directory and will be
ignored by git) with the following command:

``` sh
nvm install 16 # make sure we are using node version 16
npm install    # install the packages defined in package.json
```

### Minify CSS and JS

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the following
scripts to minify the CSS and JS:

``` sh
bash squash-sass.sh     # use the sass node module to compile CSS
bash squash-a-script.sh # use the uglifyjs node module to compile JS
```

## HTML Templates

We have customized the following templates:

- [content-chapter](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/content-chapter.md)
  displays the episodes for the lessons
- [content-syllabus](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/content-syllabus.md)
  is the landing page for the lessons
- [content-extra](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/content-extra.md)
  is used for pages that are not chapters and do not need positional
  navigation
- \[content-overview\] is like content-extra, but is meant for the home
  page of an overview lesson
- [head](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/head.md)
  contains the metadata and script loading
- [navbar](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/navbar.md)
  is a bit of misnomer, but it contains the sidebar navigation
- [header](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/header.md)
  contains metadata and favicons
- [footer](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/footer.md)
  contains navigation, credits, and JSON metadata
- [layout](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/dev/inst/pkgdown/templates/layout.md)
  pulls everything together

### Parameters

At the moment, {varnish} uses a mix of global parameters provided in a
YAML file generated for {pkgdown} and parameters (both global and
page-specific) passed directly to
[`pkgdown::render_page()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/render_page.html).
All of these parameters are provisioned by {sandpaper}, but it should be
noted that **this particular structure is expected to change** as we
move to systems such as quarto, which use pandoc templates.

#### pkgdown

[{pkgdown}](https://r-lib.github.io/pkgdown) provides the
`{{ #site }}{{ root }}{{ /site }}` parameter by default, which inserts
the path to the root folder when viewed locally and inserts the URL when
viewed on a server.

#### YAML

These parameters are recorded in a workbench lesson under
`site/_pkgdown.yaml`

``` yaml
title: {{ title }} # needed to set the site title
home:
  title: Home
  strip_header: true
  description: ~
template:
  package: varnish
  params:
    time: {{ time }}
    source: {{ source }}
    branch: {{ branch }}
    contact: {{ contact }}
    license: {{ license }}
    handout: {{ handout }}
    cp: {{ cp }}
    lc: {{ lc }}
    dc: {{ dc }}
    swc: {{ swc }}
    carpentry: {{ carpentry }}
    carpentry_name: {{ carpentry_name }}
    carpentry_icon: {{ carpentry_icon }}
    life_cycle: {{ life_cycle }}
    pre_alpha: {{ pre_alpha }}
    alpha: {{ alpha }}
    beta: {{ beta }}
```

Each of these parameters can be accessed via the `{{ yaml }}` mustache
context. For example, this adds a paragraph describing the license
provided that the `{{ license }}` parameter is present in the yaml:

``` html
{{#yaml}}{{#license}}
<p>Materials licensed under <a href="{{#site}}{{root}}{{/site}}LICENSE.html">{{license}}</a> by the authors</p>
{{/license}}{{/yaml}}
```

#### Global

(TODO: write descriptions of these parameters)

#### Page-specific

- `{{ instructor }}`: a boolean indicating instructor view
- `{{ aio }}`: a boolean indicating that the aio page should be included
- `{{ this_page }}`: The file-only HTML path of the current page
  (e.g. `index.html` or `introduction.html`).
- `{{{ schedule }}}`: The HTML sidebar of the schedule of episodes.
- `{{{ resources }}}`: an additional part of the sidebar giving extra
  resource elements avaialable in mobile view.
